# Atliq Hardware Business Analysis 📊
This repository contains a comprehensive **data analytics project** for Atliq Hardware — an end-to-end business analysis to uncover sales patterns, generate insights, and support data-driven decision-making.

The analysis heavily uses **SQL, Stored Procedures, Views, Excel reporting, and analytics logic**, with the goal of producing actionable insights and structured reports. The project includes queries fired against the database, stored procedures for reusable logic, and user-defined functions to support analytical calculations.

##  Project Overview

###  Business Problem
Atliq Hardware operates multiple sales channels across regions and product lines but lacked structured insights into:

- How sales are trending over time
- Which markets contribute most to revenue
- Product performance and profitability

This project aims to organize, analyze, and visualize key business metrics to help leadership make **data-driven decisions** with confidence.

## Business Questions Addressed

This project answers key business questions such as:

- Which markets contribute the highest net sales?
- How does sales performance vary across fiscal years?
- Which products and categories drive revenue?
- What are the top and bottom performing regions?
- How do sales trends evolve month-over-month?
Each business question maps to one or more SQL scripts in the `sql/`folder.
